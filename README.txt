# Installation
cd into the hax directory and run
`bower install`

This should give you the dependencies you need to get going. Enable the module and go to the permissions page to ensure uses have the 'use hax' permission checked. Once this is checked then people will start to see a 'HAX Authoring' local menu item / tab / contextual option show up when they have access to edit a node.

Click this, and then hit the power button in the top of the UI to get started. When your done editing hit the power button again and it'll save back to the server.

## Advanced configuration
If using other webcomponents in projects it's recommended to symlink this directory back to a shared location located in sites/all/libraries/webcomponents/polymer (or something like that).
